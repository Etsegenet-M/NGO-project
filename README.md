# NGO-Project

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Etsegent. I have created this website as a heartfelt gift for an NGO formed by
---
a group of childhood friends dedicated to giving back to their community. This site serves as a platform
---
to showcase their initiatives, share their stories, and connect with others who are passionate about
---
making a difference. I hope this website helps them in their mission to bring positive change and strengthen
---
the bonds within their community.
